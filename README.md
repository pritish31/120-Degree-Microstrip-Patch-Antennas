# Broadband 120Â° Sectoral Microstrip Antenna  

## ðŸ“„ Project Overview  
This repository contains the design, simulation, and analysis of **Broadband 120Â° Sectoral Microstrip Antennas (S-MSA)** aimed at achieving **wide bandwidth**, **high gain**, and **broadside radiation patterns** for modern wireless communication systems.  

The project explores:  
- **Proximity-fed S-MSA designs** for broadband response  
- **Gap-coupled** and **stacked antenna** variations to enhance bandwidth and gain  
- **Slot-loaded and defected ground plane** configurations for improved mode coupling
